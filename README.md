# Database_FP
Final Project for databases class
This is the final project for my db class COSI 127b with Ryan Markus.
I have sunk many hours into it and have come up with somthing that still does not work.
Even though it is a failure i am somewhat proud of my work especially my use of a mappedByteBuffer, it is (i think) close to working.
The error lies in the join algorithm. Currently it is at the same time spending too much time looping over
the joins but is also not outputing enough lines. There is somthing terribly wrong in my logic that i have do not
have time to spend fixing as i would get sucked in and can not afford that at this stage of the semester.
In summary this was a difficult project as you warned.
P.S (the merge and commit history might look weird, that is because it is. I messed up and had to fix it)
