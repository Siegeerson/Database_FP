# Database_FP
Final Project for databases class
This is my first attempt at a solution for my for my databases class (congrats Dr.Ryan BTW). 
It correctly evaluates any querry manually input into the mainTest class but is extremely slow and is inefficent in terms of space
and reads and writes to disk.
